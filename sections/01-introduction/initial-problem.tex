\section{Initial Problem}
In order to direct the domain of research in this report, an initial problem is posed. This problem will serve as the early research vector for the project. Game development is a complex task and presents a number of problems that are not directly related to the game itself\footnote{Many processes in game development facilitate the game, such as graphics rendering and physics, and are therefore not necessarily part of the game under development \cite{blow2004game}}. Veteran of the game development industry Jonathan Blow suggests that current game development languages are not sufficient and has therefore proposed a new language to replace them \cite{blowProgrammingLanguage}. In addition Tim Sweeny, another game development veteran, has suggested that game development could greatly benefit from the functional paradigm \cite{theNextMainstreanProgrammingLanguage}. Therefore the following initial problem is proposed:\\

\textbf{Does game development need new functional programming languages?}\\

%\todo[inline]{Bent skriver: "Måske ville det være bedre at tage udgangspunkt i f.eks. Jonathan Blows påstand/these at der er brug for nye sprog til spil og at disse bør være funktionelle. Så kan man jo undersøge denne hypotese"}

This exploratory question is the basis for the research conducted in the remainder of this chapter. Following this section, the state of the art technologies are explored.
