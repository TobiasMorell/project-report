\section{DSL Benchmarking}
Another interesting topic to explore in future work is how \acp{DSL} perform compared to equivalent code that is hand-written in general-purpose programming language. In order to explore this, microbenchmarks could be used to test the smallest linguistic features of the \ac{DSL} and application-benchmarks to test whole programs/components written in \acp{DSL}.
