\chapter{Benchmark Testing} \label{chap:benchmarks}
In this chapter a series of performance benchmarks are conducted; microbenchmakrs \cite{sestoft2013microbenchmarks,sestoft2010numeric} and macrobenchmarks. The benchmarks were intended to test if the common belief that interpreted languages are slower than compiled languages is in fact true. In order to test this, the game engines Godot and CryEngine were used, as they both claim support for an interpreted (GDScript and Lua respectively), a \ac{JIT}-compiled (C\#) and a compiled (C++) language. Due to problems with the both engines the focus swifted and the chapter instead examines the performance of four different popular game engines; Unity, Unreal Engine, CryEngine and Godot.
